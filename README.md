## About Me
I'm interested in entrepreneurship, self-improvement. Enjoy listening to podcasts, reading books, programming. Also I like listenig to people and learning from their experiences.
I also love connecting with like-minded individuals who share my passion for technology, stoicism and self-growth.

## ðŸ“« How to reach me 
-I will update soon.

## Facts about me
- Hardships are my personal trainers--no pain, no gain!
- Trust issues? Oh yeah, I've got a collection.
- If I'm not 100% sure, I'm not doing it, 'cuz who wants to mess up and regret it later (not a f*ck up).
- I plan everything out before I dive in. Spontaneity? Not my style!
- Dreaming of settling in Finland and building snowman(I love snow).
- Used to have imaginary friends named Matthew and luna--good times!
- Living life with good ol' moral values, which apparently makes me the "boring Gen-Z" kid ...
- Haven't met many like-minded people yet, so no friends for 17 years (yep, all my life!). Hoping to find my friends soon!
- I rarely reply to WhatsApp chats. Why chat if there's nothing important to say?
- I'll speak up when I actually need something. I prefer listening over talking, so my usual responses are "yes", "no", "why", "okay", or something equally short and sweet.
- I'm all about making decisions after doing some solid research.
- I live by observing things and creating patterns, kinda like my own little science experiment!
- Huge winter lover.
- I avoid talking about me.
- Love spending nights alone on my rooftop, enjoying the cold breeze. I relax, watch stars and satellites, I give the moon philosophical lectures; it never judges!
- A night owl -- I find silence so satisfying , with no one to question or disturb me.
- During holidays, my study room is my fortress. I basically live there and never come out--ultimate hideout!
- I despise crowded places and avoid them whenever possible. But sometimes, they're unavoidable.
- When I want something, I do all in, giving it my blood, sweat, and tears.
- I wanna be the best version of myself. I'm cutting down on dopamine for that extra edge.
